Project 6 - 4706

Compiled with "make"

How to Run:
    ./oss [ -h ] -p

    -h for usage

    -p to indicate the number of user processes in the system. Use 20 as the default value.


Issues: 
    bit vector not implemented and memory layout is not displayed. 
    semaphores are initialized but never used, messages are used instead.
