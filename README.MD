Project 6 - 4706

Compiled with "make"

How to Run:
    ./oss [ -h ] -p

    -h for usage

    -p to indicate the number of user processes in the system. Use 20 as the default value.


Issues: 
    having an issue with fork but all the logic is working properly so the file prints mostly correct
    bit vector not implemented and memory layout is not displayed. 
    semaphores are initialized but never used, messages are used instead.
